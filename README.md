## Overview

**OpenGL Learning** is a modular rendering project written in C++ and powered by pure OpenGL. It currently features a symbolic solar system demonstration but is architected to support any 3D model or scene through an extensible engine layer.

This project is intended both as a learning tool and as a portfolio piece showcasing engine structure, graphics programming, and software engineering best practices.
